                <div class="story-content">
                    Once there was a merchant named Ahmad who sold the finest dates in the market. One day, a customer accidentally dropped extra coins while paying. Ahmad could have kept the money, but he ran after the customer to return it.
                    <br><br>
                    "Why did you return my money?" asked the surprised customer. Ahmad replied, "Because honesty is more valuable than any wealth. Allah sees all our actions, and I want His blessings on my business."
                    <br><br>
                    Word of Ahmad's honesty spread throughout the city, and his business prospered beyond imagination. People came from far and wide just to buy from the honest merchant.

                    Fatima was a young girl who lived next to an elderly woman named Bibi Khadija. Every day after school, Fatima would help her neighbor with groceries, cleaning, and cooking. Her friends often asked why she spent so much time helping instead of playing.
                    <br><br>
                    "The Prophet (PBUH) said that the best of people are those who benefit others," Fatima would reply. "Bibi Khadija has no family here, so we are her family."
                    <br><br>
                    Years later, when Fatima faced difficulties in her studies, the entire neighborhood came together to help her, inspired by the kindness she had shown to others.

                    Hassan was a farmer who worked hard every day, but his crops kept failing due to drought. His neighbors mocked him and said, "Why don't you give up? Allah is not blessing your work!"
                    <br><br>
                    Hassan replied with a smile, "I trust in Allah's wisdom. Perhaps He is testing my patience and faith. I will continue to work and make dua."

                    After three years of patience and continuous effort, the rains finally came. Hassan's farm became the most prosperous in the region, and he shared his harvest with those who had mocked him.
