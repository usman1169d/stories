                <div class="story-content">
                   Hakim was coughing at night and could not sleep. Mum took him to the doctor to get a cough mixture. That night and the following night there was no improvement to his cough.
                   <br><br>
                   Next day mum was talking to her friend and she suggested making a home remedy. Her friend Jasmina said that she used a home remedy with the whole family and it worked well by the will of Allah SWT. 
                   <br><br>
                   Mum gave Hakim Coffhelp. Hakim said, "Bismillah [In the name of Allah]."
                   Mum said, "Let us make a dua to Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta'ala). It is Allah who heals us."
                   Then Hakim said, "Ya Allah! heal me."
                   <br><br>
                   The first night Hakim still coughed but it was not as bad. With each passing night mum noticed Hakim was coughing less and less and Hakim was getting a more peaceful sleep.
                   <br><br>
                   After a few days Hakim was able to sleep through the night without coughing. Hakim wanted to share this news with grandma so he called her and said, "Grandma my cough is gone, Alhamdulillah [Praise be to Allah SWT]. I can sleep through the night. Coffhelp has worked. You must use it when you have a cough."
                   <br><br>
                   Grandma said, "Alhamdulillah, you are feeling well again. Hakim, Coffhelp has worked only because Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta'ala) has willed it. You should say, by the will of Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta'ala) Coffhelp has worked and I don't cough anymore, Alhamdulillah."

                    Zainab worked hard to save money for her Hajj pilgrimage. One day, her trusted friend Maryam asked to borrow the money for a family emergency, promising to return it before Hajj season. Months passed, but Maryam couldn't repay the money and avoided Zainab.
                    <br><br>
                    Instead of being angry, Zainab went to Maryam's house with a smile. "Sister, I forgive this debt. Your family's need was greater than my Hajj. Allah will provide another way for me."
                    <br><br>
                    That same week, Zainab unexpectedly received enough money from a distant relative to complete her Hajj. Her act of forgiveness had opened doors of unexpected blessings.

                <h2 class="story-title">The Mice and the Elephant</h2>
                <div class="story-content">
                    Once upon a time there was a colony of mice who feared the elephants. Whenever the elephants walked through the mice's land with their enormous feet many mice were harmed.
                    <br><br>
                    One day, the mouse king went to the King of the Elephants and said, "If you spare our lives, we will help you in a time of need." The elephant king agreed. He ordered the elephants to be careful never to step on a single mouse.
                    <br><br>
                    From that day forth the elephants paid attention and lifted their huge legs carefully, never harming their tiny friends. If they entered the land of the mice, they lifted their trunks and trumpeted a warning; "We are walking. We are walking."

                    One day, elephant trappers came to the forest. They were seeking many elephants for the human king's soldiers to ride into battle. Day by day more and more elephants were caught in great rope traps.
                    <br><br>
                    The elephant king was very sad. Then, he remembered the promise of the mice and sent for his little friend, the mouse king. The king of the mice arrived and listened to the elephant's story.
                    <br><br>
                    Then the mouse king called all the mice together. Thousands and thousands of mice gathered to discuss how they might help the elephants. No one had forgotten how their huge friends had spared their lives. One clever mouse made a plan. All the mice rejoiced.
                    <br><br>
                    The mice formed into little groups. Each group gnawed the ropes of a single trap with their tiny sharp teeth. By morning, all the elephants were freed. Frustrated, the trappers left the forest.

                <div class="story-content">
                    Nabil looks into the padi field and watches the tadpoles swimming. It is the planting season and the padi field is flooded. Farmers are going to remove the seedlings from the seed beds and transplant them into the flooded fields. The warm, wet climate in the tropics is ideal for growing padi. Meantime the tadpoles are having fun swimming in the empty field.
                    <br><br>
                    Nabil is waiting for his father to take him to the masjid. He can hear his father calling him, "Nabil, where are you?" (Aina anta, ya Nabil?) Nabil replies, "I am coming, Dad." He rushes to the road to meet his father.
                    <br><br>
                    As they start walking they hear a sound, squiissh, squiissh, squiissh, squiissh. "What is that noise?" asks Nabil. They stop to listen, but the noise stops as well. As they start walking again, they hear the noise again, squiissh, squiissh, squiissh, squiissh. Again they stop to listen. Again the noise stops. They are very puzzled. " Is someone following us?" asks Nabil, as he looks back. But there is no one there. What could the noise be? Is it a bird in the sky or an insect in the padi field? Again as they start walking they hear the noise.
                    <br><br>
                    Nabil looks down at his shoes and squeals in delight. "Its my shoes, they are wet and are making this squiisshing sound." They both laugh gleefully. His father looks at Nabil's shoes and exclaims, "Nabil, there is a hole in your shoe. We need to buy you a new pair of shoes. Next week when I get some money, insha Allah, I will put aside some money for your shoes first."
                    <br><br>
                    Nabil is very excited. Shopping for new shoes will be fun.
                    <br><br>
                    On Monday after school, Nabil asks his father, "Dad, can we go shopping for my shoes?" His father says, "Sabar (be patient), Nabil." Then Nabil says to his father, "Dad, today I saw my friend Azman wearing a nice pair of black shoes." His father says, "Alhamdulillah, that is what Allah (subhanahu wa Ta'ala) has given to him."
                    <br><br>
                    On Tuesday after school, Nabil asks his father again, "Dad, can we go shopping for my shoes?" His father says the same thing, "Sabar, Nabil." Then Nabil says to his father, "Dad, today I saw Ustaz Marwan wearing a new pair of white shoes." His father says, "Alhamdulillah, that is what Allah s.w.t has given to him."
                    <br><br>
                    On Wednesday after school, Nabil asks his father again, "Dad, can we go shopping for my shoes?" His father says, "Sabar, Nabil." "Nabil, today I saw the postman wearing smart blue shoes." This time Nabil says, "Alhamdulillah, that is what Allah (subhanahu wa Ta'ala) has given to him."
                    <br><br>
                    On Sunday again Nabil says, "Dad, can we go shopping for my shoes?" His father says, "Yes, today after salatul Zohor, insha Allah, we will go and buy your shoes." Nabil performs his salatul Zohor and quickly gets ready to go out shopping.
                    <br><br>
                    At the shoe shop, Nabil sees a nice pair of black shoes. "Dad, these shoes look very smart," says Nabil. His father says, "Yes, they look great, Nabil." His father looks at the price. "Nabil, we can only spend $25 for your shoes. These shoes cost $55. It would be a waste to buy these expensive shoes. This is an extravagance. We would be spending an extra $30. Allah (subhanahu wa Ta'ala) does not want us to be extravagant, Nabil. What do you think we can use the $30 for?
                    <br><br>
                    "Okay, Dad," Nabil says. "We will not be extravagant." Nabil always obeys his father, he is a soleh child.
                    <br><br>
                    Then Nabil sees a pair of brown shoes that look very nice. "Dad, these shoes are $27 only, can I buy them," asks Nabil. His father looks at the shoes and says, "Yes, Nabil, these shoes are just right for you."
                    <br><br>
                    As the salesman looks for the right size of shoes, Nabil wanders around the shop and soon sees a pair of white shoes that cost $17 only. He likes the shoelaces on them. There are little bells dangling at the end of the shoelaces. "Dad, Dad," Nabil calls as he runs to the other side of the shop in excitement. "Can I buy these pair of white shoes with the little bells on them. They are cheaper than the brown shoes; we will save money too. Do you know how much money we will save Dads?"
                    <br><br>
                    "Are you sure you want these shoes Nabil. I don't mind paying $27 for the brown shoes, if you want them," his father says. "No, I don't want the expensive brown shoes. I want these white shoes which are cheaper. Dad, we must not waste money.
                    <br><br>
                    His father smiles when Nabil finishes reading the verse. He says, "Well, Nabil, now you have a new pair of white shoes." Nabil replies, "Alhamdulillah, this is what Allah (subhanahu wa Ta'ala) has given to me."
                    <br><br>
                    Nabil is very happy. He keeps looking at his new white shoes, smiles and keeps saying, "Alhamdulillah, Alhamdulillah."
                    <br><br>
                    On the way back, Nabil's father says, "Nabil you can have the $10 we saved by buying these white shoes. You can do what you want with it, but remember to do only those things that will earn you the pleasure of Allah (swt) When Allah (subhanahu wa Ta'ala) brings rezeki to us He also waits to see what we do with it. This $10 comes to you from Allah (subhanahu wa Ta'ala)"
                    <br><br>
                    The next day Nabil is thinking of what he would like to do with all that money. It is a lot of money and he has never had so much before. At first he thinks he would like to spend all the money on ice cream or chocolates or even buy that toy car he has seen at the supermarket. Just the thought of it makes him very excited. But then he asks himself, "Will Allah (subhanahu wa Ta'ala) be pleased with me if I spend all the money on myself?"
                    <br><br>
                    Next day after school he sits down with his father and starts writing down his ideas. Nabil decides to use the money in five different ways. Nabil starts think, "How much money is there for me to use for each way if I divide $10 into five ways?" Nabil sees that he has $2 to give his mother, whom he loves very much. He can spend $2 for himself, he can use $2 to buy treats for his brothers and sisters, he can save $2 and the last $2 he can give to the poor family who lives near the masjid. He says to himself, " Allah (subhanahu wa Ta'ala) will be pleased with me if I use the money in this way rather than if I spend it all on myself."
                    <br><br>
                    Next day he goes with his mum to visit the poor family. When they reach the house they hear some children crying. Nabil and his mum say, "Assalamu Alaikum, Makcik Meriam." Makcik comes out and replies, "Wa alaikumus Salam." One little girl follows makcik and keeps saying, "I am hungry, mak. I am hungry, mak. Give me some food?"
                    <br><br>
                    Nabil's mother gives some old clothes to makcik. Nabil gives his $2. Makcik is very happy and says, "Alhamdulillah." She immediately whispers to her son to go and buy a packet of rice so that she can cook it for his little sister. There is nothing in the house to eat. Even though she speaks very softly Nabil and his mother can hear.
                    <br><br>
                    Nabil is very upset and shocked that there is nothing to eat in Makcik Meriams house. At his house there is always something to eat. He puts his hand in his pocket and feels the balance of the money. He realizes that makcik needs the money to feed the family but he does not need the extra money. He decides to give all the balance of $8 to Makcik. He immediately sees her face light up even more as she keeps repeating, "Alhamdulillah, Masha Allah." She tells her son to buy some more rice and dried fish.
                    <br><br>
                    When they reach home, Nabil starts crying as he remembers makcik's family who has no food in their house. His mother consoles him and says, " Allah (subhanahu wa Ta'ala) sends rezeki to whomever he chooses. Allah (subhanahu wa Ta'ala) gives more to some and waits to see whether they will spend it all for themselves or they will share with those who are in need."
                    <br><br>
                    Nabil looks at his new shoes and says, "Alhamdulillah, I am glad I bought this pair of white shoes and saved $10 and therefore could give it to makcik's family."

                    Ahmed ran a small bakery that barely made enough profit to support his family. Every morning, he would set aside fresh bread for the poor, even when his own family had simple meals. His wife sometimes worried, "Ahmed, we don't have much ourselves. Maybe we should keep more for our children?"

                    But Ahmed would smile and say, "Allah has blessed us with the ability to make bread. The least we can do is share with those who have none." Every day, he would quietly place a bag of fresh bread outside the mosque for anyone in need, never expecting anything in return.
                    <br><br>
                    One day, a wealthy businessman visited the neighborhood and tasted Ahmed's bread. "This is extraordinary! Who taught you to bake like this?" When he learned about Ahmed's daily charity, he was so impressed that he offered Ahmed a partnership to open bakeries across the city.

                    "Sometimes I gave away my last loaf," Ahmed later told his wife, "but Allah always sent us more customers the next day. Generosity is never wasted in Allah's economy."

                    Ali was a poor fisherman who often returned home empty-handed while other fishermen caught plenty. His wife would worry about feeding their children, but Ali always said, "Allah knows what we need. Tomorrow, In sha Allah, will be better."
                    <br><br>
                    One stormy day, when all other fishermen stayed home, Ali decided to try his luck. "Bismillah," he said, casting his net into the rough waters. After hours of patient waiting, his net felt unusually heavy. When he pulled it up, he found not fish, but a chest filled with precious pearls lost from a merchant ship.

                    The pearls were worth more than Ali could earn in a lifetime. He sold them honestly and used the money not just for his family, but to help other struggling fishermen in his village. His patience and trust in Allah's timing had been rewarded beyond his wildest dreams.

                    During Ramadan, he prepared free iftar packages for families who couldn't afford them. His wife said, "Mahmoud, we barely have enough for ourselves. How can we give so much away?" He replied, "Allah is Ar-Razzaq (The Provider). When we feed others, He feeds us."

When our hearts are small like the glass, these troubles make everything bitter. But when we expand our hearts through patience, gratitude, and trust in Allah—like the vast lake—the same troubles become insignificant. The secret to happiness is not avoiding problems, but expanding our hearts to be bigger than any problem."
                    <br><br>
                    With those words, the teacher peacefully passed away, leaving his students with the greatest lesson of all: that a heart connected to Allah is vast enough to contain any sorrow and still overflow with peace.
